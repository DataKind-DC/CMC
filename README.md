# Chesapeake Monitoring Cooperative (CMC)

The Chesapeake Monitoring Cooperative (CMC) 

DataKind DC (DKDC) hopes to use the data collected and standardized by CMC to help the organization better understand monitoring activities. This analysis might include identifying impactful patterns in the data which would encourage more scientists and states to use the data and understanding any gaps in data collection} so they can continue to build this useful open data resource for future scientific efforts. 

## Project Objective

At the April 2019 DKDC DataDive, participants worked with CMC partners to develop an interactive web app to allow users to explore the data collected through CMC's efforts. CMC would like the data to be more easily available for filtering and downloading. 

### App

The visualization app is built with [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/). To run the app locally, you will need to clone the repository and install the required modules.
